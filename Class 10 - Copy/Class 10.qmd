## The PDB database

The main repository of biomolecular structure data is called the PDB found at https://www.rcsb.org/ 

Let's see what this database contains. I went to PDB > Analyze > PDB statistics > By Exp method and molecular type

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```
> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```

The comma in these number is causing them to be read as character rather than numeric

I can fix this by replacing "," for nothing "" with the `sub()` function

```{r}
x <- pdbstats$X.ray
sum( as.numeric(sub(",","",x)))
```

Or I can use the **readr** package and the `read_csv()`

```{r}
#install.packages('tidyverse')
library(readr)
pdbstats <- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```

I want to clean the column names so that theya re lowercase and don't habve spaces in them.

```{r}
colnames(pdbstats)
```


```{r}
#install.packages('janitor')
library(janitor)
df <- clean_names(pdbstats)
df
```

Total number of X.ray

```{r}
sum(df$x_ray)
```

Total number of structures
```{r}
sum(df$total)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?


```{r}
sum (df$x_ray)/sum(df$total) * 100
```

Percent of EM structures 

```{r}
sum(df$em)/sum(df$total) * 100
```

## 2. Using Mol*

The main Mol* homepage at: https://molstar.org/viewer/. We can input our own PDB files or just give it a PDB database accession code.

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

It is in ball and stick mode, which represents the water as a dot.

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

Water 308

> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

## 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

We canuyse the **bio3d** package for structural bioinformatics to read PDB data into R

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```
>Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

```{r}
length( pdbseq(pdb))
```

>Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

MK1

>Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2 chains, A and B

Looking at the `pdb` object in more detail

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```
```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Let's try a new function not yet in the bio3d package. It requires the **r3dmol** package that we need to install with`install.packages("r3dnol")`

```{r}
#install.packages("shiny")
#install.packages("r3dnol")
source("https://tinyurl.com/viewpdb")
#view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor = "pink")
```

## 4. predicting fucntional dynamics

We can use the `nma()` function in bio3d to predict the large-scale functional 

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```


```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```
Write out a trajectory of the predicted molecular motion:

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
